Key Methodologies:
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Organized data from raw form into structured insights, ensuring accuracy and relevance.
Descriptive Analytics: Analyzed demographic data to find trends, such as the percentage of customers with bikes, purchasing tendencies by gender, and impact of income on bike purchases.
Customer Segmentation Analysis: Grouped customers by attributes (e.g., age group, marital status) to highlight target demographics.
Dashboards and Reports: Created visual summaries that display overall purchasing trends, customer profiles, and regions with higher purchase rates.

Tools and Technologies:
Data Processing: Excel for data organization and calculations.
Visualization: Excel Dashboards to display insights on buyer profiles and purchasing patterns.
Data Structuring: Used SQL concepts in hypothetical migration planning for more robust data handling.
